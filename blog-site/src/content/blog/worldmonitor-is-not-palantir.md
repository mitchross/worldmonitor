Run this in a terminal:

```bash
curl "https://www.worldmonitor.app/api/health?compact=1"
```

No API key. No sales call. No contract. Here's what it returned the moment this paragraph was written (July 22, 2026):

```json
{
  "status": "WARNING",
  "summary": { "total": 232, "ok": 229, "warn": 2, "onDemandWarn": 1, "crit": 0 },
  "problems": {
    "globalTendersSam": { "status": "SEED_ERROR", "records": 77, "seedAgeMin": 355 }
  }
}
```

That's WorldMonitor monitoring 232 of its own data sources — and publicly reporting, to anyone who asks, that its US government-tenders feed was stale at that moment because SAM.gov was rate-limiting us. We didn't clean that up for this post. The failure report *is* the point.

Now try getting Palantir to show you anything at all this afternoon.

## The comparison we keep getting

There's a third-party explainer of our codebase titled ["worldmonitor: The Open-Source Palantir Running in Your Browser."](https://repo-explainer.com/koala73/worldmonitor) Supporters introduce us the same way. "Open-source Palantir" has become a whole genre — other projects [market themselves with exactly that phrase](https://osirisai.live/). We understand the shorthand: dark map, live data, global scope. One thank-you covers it: when people reach for a $400-billion company as the reference point for a free dashboard, the ambition landed.

But the comparison mistakes what both things are. And the mistake is worth correcting precisely, because what WorldMonitor actually is turns out to be more useful to more people.

## What Palantir is — credit where due

Palantir builds data-integration software for institutions. Gotham, Foundry, and AIP take a customer's *own* data — case files, logistics ledgers, sensor logs — and make it queryable inside a private ontology, behind the customer's walls, under a negotiated contract. It is genuinely excellent at that job, which is why institutions pay what they pay.

Note what that job is: **Palantir makes your private data usable by you.** It doesn't primarily provide data. If your organization has nothing to integrate, Palantir has nothing to sell you.

## What WorldMonitor is

WorldMonitor inverts every term of that sentence: **it makes the world's public data usable by everyone.** UCDP conflict events, IMF PortWatch ship transits, EIA petroleum stocks, OFAC designations, UNHCR displacement, USGS seismographs, Eurostat series, prediction-market odds, 567 curated news feeds — ingested continuously, classified, mapped, and published to a URL with no login.

And despite the war-room aesthetic that invites the Palantir shorthand, the center of gravity is **economic**. Count the surface: [markets and central-bank trackers](/blog/posts/real-time-market-intelligence-for-traders-and-analysts/), [chokepoints and freight](/blog/posts/tracking-global-trade-routes-chokepoints-freight-costs/), [tariffs and customs revenue](/blog/posts/tariff-tracker-trade-policy-monitoring-worldmonitor/), [government tenders from six official portals](/blog/posts/government-tenders-procurement-intelligence-worldmonitor/), [shelf-price inflation](/blog/posts/ground-truth-inflation-shelf-price-tracking-worldmonitor/), energy intelligence, prediction markets.

Here's the sanctions layer, queried live while writing this (July 22, 2026): **20,398 active OFAC designations** — 19,345 SDN plus 1,053 consolidated — including 1,517 vessels and 344 aircraft. Russia carries 5,931 country-tagged entries against Iran's 1,607, and the single largest program, `RUSSIA-EO14024`, holds 6,794. That's not a marketing claim about "tracking sanctions." That's the data, and you can pull the same numbers right now through the [MCP server](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/mcp-quickstart) or the [API](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/api-reference).

Conflict tracking is real and serious on WorldMonitor — but it's there because **war is an economic event**. When Hormuz goes yellow, tankers reroute, freight and insurance reprice, energy flows shift, sanctions programs swell. The red dots matter because of what they do to prices, routes, and policy. Palantir pattern-matches to the map; it misses that most of the platform is telling you what the map costs.

## The structural difference: open at the layers that matter

- **The product is open**: six dashboards, free, no signup, right now.
- **The source is open**: the entire platform is AGPL-3.0 — [read it, fork it, self-host it](/blog/posts/self-host-worldmonitor-open-source-osint-dashboard/).
- **The interfaces are open**: a versioned REST API built on 35 typed proto services, an [MCP server with 41 tools](/blog/posts/worldmonitor-mcp-server-ai-agents-real-time-intelligence/) that answers anonymous connections, an [embeddable live map](/blog/posts/embed-live-global-map-worldmonitor/), 25 UI languages.
- **The pricing is open**: [published on the site](/blog/posts/free-vs-paid-real-time-intelligence-dashboards/), $0 to flat monthly tiers, no "contact sales."

And, in fairness, what WorldMonitor is **not**: it is not fully free at every layer — a handful of compute-heavy panels (the AI analyst, the Scenario Engine, tender search, trade policy) are paid, and they fund the free rest. It has no classified feeds and no private ontology for your internal data — if you need *your* data integrated, that's genuinely Palantir's job, not ours. And public data has gaps; where sensors don't exist, WorldMonitor shows the gap rather than interpolating confidence.

That last habit is the deepest difference. A closed platform's failures are private. Ours are on the health endpoint you curled above.

## Build on it this afternoon — literally

The claim "you can build on it" is cheap, so here is the afternoon, itemized:

1. **Minute 1:** `curl "https://www.worldmonitor.app/api/health?compact=1"` — you did this already.
2. **Minute 5:** Add `https://worldmonitor.app/mcp` to Claude or any MCP client — the server accepts anonymous connections with a daily quota, no account — and ask *"what's the chokepoint status in Hormuz right now?"*
3. **The rest of the afternoon:** wire a [supply-chain early-warning pipeline](/blog/posts/build-supply-chain-early-warning-system-api/), pipe [risk alerts into Slack](/blog/posts/geopolitical-risk-alerts-slack-teams-worldmonitor-api/), or [give your agent live world context](/blog/posts/build-geopolitical-risk-agent-worldmonitor-mcp/) — or fork the repo and change what you don't like.

Palantir is excellent software you cannot try this afternoon. That's not a criticism — it's a different species of thing. But it's why the comparison fails in our favor for everyone who isn't a government or a Fortune 100.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is WorldMonitor a Palantir alternative?**

For integrating your institution's private data into a closed ontology — no, and it doesn't try to be. For real-time intelligence over public data — markets, trade, conflicts, energy, sanctions — it does something Palantir doesn't sell at any price: it's live in your browser right now, free, with the source published.

**Is WorldMonitor a defense or war-focused platform?**

No. Conflict monitoring is one layer among dozens; by surface area most of the platform is financial, economic, and trade intelligence. War matters on WorldMonitor because it reprices the world — which is why traders and supply-chain teams read it alongside OSINT analysts.

**Is everything really free?**

The dashboards, the map layers, the briefs, and anonymous MCP access are free with no login. A few compute-heavy features (AI analyst, Scenario Engine, tender search, trade policy) are paid and fund the rest. The source is AGPL-3.0 — self-hosters get everything their own keys can feed.

**Palantir helps institutions see what they already own. WorldMonitor helps anyone see what the world is already saying — and you're one `curl` away from checking that claim yourself.**
